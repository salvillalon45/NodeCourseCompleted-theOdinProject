## Intro

Here you will find all the projects that I completed along with their GitHub Repo for the NodeJS module in the Odin Project.

The course consisted of 17 lessons and 7 projects. Some of the concepts I learned:

-   Setting up a backend with NodeJS and ExpressJS
-   Using MongoDB as my database
-   CRUD & MVC Patterns
-   Setting up authentication using PassportJS
-   How to serve views from the backends using EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating)
-   Creating APIs that serve multiple Frontends 
-   Deploying backend apps using Heroku
-   Unit Testing (Jest)

The projects were more focused on the Backend. I challenged myself to practice my Frontend skills by:
-   Using TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript
-   Setting up TypeScript and Gastby projects
-   SWR Hooks for better API fetchings and mutations
-   Creating my own reusable hooks
-   Using SWR Hooks I no longer needed to depend on parent child components for passing down data. 
-   I learned how efficient a library like SWR Hooks can be over React Context and Redux
-   Dribble (For design inspiration)
-   Gatsby Framework
-   Netlify
